<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul type="none">
<li>2 ripe avocados chopped</li>
<li>200 g good quality dark eating chocolate</li>
<li>1/2cup milk</li>
<li>2 tablespoons liquid honey or pure maple syrup</li>
<li>fresh berries or any other fruit</li>
<li>grated chocolate</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>01.Melt chocolate in a double boiler or in a glass bowl set above a pot of simmering water (make sure the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl or else it will risk the chocolate burning or becoming grainy).</p>

<p>02.Place avocado and melted chocolate in a food processor and blend together until smooth, whilst pouring in the milk. Keep blending until the mousse is very smooth and creamy. Taste, and if you would like it a little sweeter, you can add a bit of honey or maple syrup, however I think it’s sweet enough as is! Spoon into serving glasses and chill in fridge briefly for 10-15 minutes. Garnish with fresh berries and extra chocolate if desired.</p>



<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This Chocolate Avocado Mousse dessert is rich and creamy, yet much healthier than your standard chocolate mousse. Avocados give it a thick creamy texture, and also make this dessert dairy-free and much lower in saturated fat. You could garnish it with anything – fruit, grated chocolate, nuts or shredded coconut for example. *To make it dairy-free, make sure the dark chocolate you are using is dairy-free (many above 70% cocoa are) and use dairy-free milk e.g. almond or coconut</p>
