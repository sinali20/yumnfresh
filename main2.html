<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul type="none">
<li>1 cup quinoa, rinsed and drained</li>
<li>2 cups water</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>1 small onion, diced</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 zucchini, diced</li>
<li>1 small eggplant, diced</li>
<li>1 tomato, diced</li>
<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
<li>1 bell pepper, tops cut off and seeded</li>
<li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>

</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>01.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a deep baking dish with aluminum foil.</p>

<p>02.Mix quinoa and water in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water is absorbed, about 15 minutes.</p>

<p>03.Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic until fragrant and slightly translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add zucchini, eggplant, and tomato; cook until slightly tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir tomato sauce into vegetable mixture; cover and simmer until vegetables have softened, about 10 more minutes.</p>

<p>04. Stir quinoa into vegetable mixture. Season with salt and pepper. Fill bell peppers with a quinoa-vegetable mixture. Place peppers in prepared baking dish. Cover dish with aluminum foil.</p>

<p>05. Bake in the preheated oven until bell peppers are slightly tender, about 18 minutes. Remove aluminum foil cover; sprinkle peppers with mozzarella cheese. Bake until cheese is bubbling and melted, about 5 more minutes.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>This can be prepped ahead of time and baked when youâ€™d like to eat them! Great for meal prep.</p>
<p>You may have a little extra filling depending on the size of bell peppers you use. About 3 large bell peppers works well, or 5 smaller.</p>
<p>If you are not vegetarian and have any leftover ground turkey, ground beef, or chicken these are a great way to use up those leftovers. Stir into the quinoa mixture before filling bell peppers. </p>
<p>Use rice instead of quinoa, if desired</p>
<p>Use 1 taco seasoning packet in place of the homemade taco seasoning if desired.</p>
