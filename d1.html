<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul type="none">
<li> 5 tablespoons chia seeds</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups unsweetened vanilla almond milk</li>
<li>sweetener of choice (I used about 4 drops of liquid stevia)</li>
<li> 1 cup raspberries, strawberries, or a combination</li>
<li>1 cup blueberries</li>
<li>1/4 cup sliced toasted almonds, for serving</li>
<li>24 small fresh basil leaves</li>
<li>1/4 cup balsamic glaze (see note)</li>
<li>A few fresh berries, for serving</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>01.In a quart sized jar or storage bowl, stir together the chia seeds, almond milk, and sweetener. Let sit and gel for about 10 minutes. Stir again, cover and store in the refrigerator overnight.</p>

<p>02.Meanwhile, make the berry sauce(s). Place the berries in a small sauce pan. I used two pans, one for the bright red berries, and one for the dark purple berries, to keep the colors separate, but that's not necessary. Add about 1/4 cup of water to the pan, bring to a low simmer, and cover. Stir every so often and break up the berries with a wooden spoon or spatula. Uncover and let the berries stew until they form a nice thick sauce. Add more water as needed if it dries out. Transfer to storage bowls and let cool, then store in the refrigerator.</p>

<p>03.To serve, assemble the chia pudding and berry sauces in layers in jars, or in a bowl. Top with almonds and fresh berries.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>You can use fresh or frozen berries. Frozen berries are a good choice when fresh berries aren't in season. A splash of maple syrup also works well for sweetening your pudding if you don't like stevia.</p>
