<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p><u>Sauce</u></p>

<ul type="none">
<li>2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots</li>
<li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
<li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
<li>6 tablespoons cold butter</li>
<li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill</li>
<li>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh chives</li>
<li>1/8 teaspoon pepper</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Salmon</u></p>

<ul type="none">
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
<li>1 lb. salmon fillets, cut into 4 pieces</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>01.Heat gas or charcoal grill. In small saucepan, combine shallots, wine and 3 tablespoons lemon juice. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium; cook 5 to 7 minutes or until mixture is reduced to about 2 to 3 tablespoons, stirring occasionally.</p>

<p>02.Remove from heat. Stir in cold butter 1 tablespoon at a time until each is well blended. Stir in dill, chives and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Cover to keep warm.</p>

<p>03.In small bowl, combine oil and 1 tablespoon lemon juice; mix well. Brush over salmon fillets. Sprinkle with salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.</p>

<p>When grill is heated, place salmon, skin side up, on gas grill over medium heat or on charcoal grill 4 to 6 inches from medium coals. Cook 8 to 10 minutes or until fish flakes easily with fork, turning once and brushing occasionally with any remaining oil mixture. If necessary, reheat butter sauce over very low heat, stirring constantly. Serve salmon with butter sauce.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>To broil salmon, place on foil-lined sheet pan. Broil 4 to 6 inches from heat using grilling times as a guide, turning once and brushing with any remaining oil mixture as directed. Be sure to keep a close eye on salmon while broiling.</p>

<p>Sprinkle the salmon with toasted white and black sesame seeds and a good shower of slivered green onions or torn fresh cilantro leaves for a pretty finish.</p>

<p>Look for wild salmon from Alaska in the summer time, farmed Scottish salmon year-round, or steelhead trout (which has the same red, rich flesh like salmon). When you cut the fillet into pieces make the thinner end, closest to the tail, into wider pieces. Put the thicker pieces on the grill for a few minutes before adding the thinner pieces.</p>

<p>Salmon fillets that are cut into an even thickness will be easier to grill, because they will all be ready at the same time.</p>

<p>Salmon is perfectly done when it is pink, cloudy-looking and flakes easiy with a fork.</p>

<p>This sauce recipe is adapted from the classic French sauce, beurre blanc, which means white butter.</p>

<p>To store fresh herbs, wrap them in slightly damp paper towels, place them inside a resealable food-storage plastic bag, and refrigerate.</p>
